# ParcelJS + TypeScript + React + Redux-observable

## Description

Architecture with React + ParcelJS + Typescript + Redux-observable. (And testing with Jest, of course)

PD: This is not similar to create-react-app in the sense that there is no hidden configuration in node_modules, it is based in ParcelJS, a bundler ready to automate most things, looking to have zero configuration, even targeting large scale projects.

You should have a look at https://parceljs.org/ it will surprise you.
